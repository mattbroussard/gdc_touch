# About

This is the source for Matt Broussard's and Robert Lynch's touch kiosk web interface for GDC (part of the BWI project).
Open source code from jQuery, iScroll, and Font Awesome libraries are included.

# Usage Notes

- To specify location, use a GET parameter in the form of ?location=3N to specify 3rd floor north, for example.
- Not included here for licensing reasons are several Helvetica font files that are needed for the application to display correctly. Also, map images have been omitted for security reasons. If you need to run the application, ask us in person for these.
