This is the source for Matt Broussard's and Robert Lynch's touch kiosk web interface for GDC (part of the BWI project).

Not included here for licensing reasons are several Helvetica font files that are needed for the application to display correctly. If you need to run the application, ask us in person for these.

Open source code from jQuery, iScroll, and Font Awesome libraries are included.
